# Domain Layer

The domain layer represents the core business logic of the application, independent of any UI, database, or external services. It contains business rules, use cases, and domain-specific logic that define how the application functions.

## Structure

The domain layer is organized into the following components:

- **Use Cases**: Business operations that orchestrate the flow of data and implement complex business rules.
- **Helpers**: Reusable functions and utilities that support the use cases with common functionality.
- **Models**: Domain entities and value objects (if applicable).

## Principles

1. **Business-centric**: The domain layer focuses on business needs rather than technical details.
2. **Framework-agnostic**: It should not depend on any external frameworks, libraries or UI components.
3. **Pure Logic**: It contains business rules and logic without side effects.
4. **Dependency Inversion**: Higher-level modules (like use cases) don't depend on implementation details.

## Flow of Control

In our application architecture, the domain layer sits between the UI (screens/hooks) and the data layer (services/repositories):

```
UI Layer (Screens/Hooks) → Domain Layer (Use Cases/Helpers) → Data Layer (Services/Repositories)
```

The domain layer acts as the bridge that translates user intent into data operations, while enforcing business rules.

## Best Practices

1. Keep the domain layer independent of external concerns.
2. Use composition over inheritance for reusability.
3. Focus on business requirements and use domain-specific language.
4. Ensure testability by designing for dependency injection.
5. Maintain clear boundaries between domain and other layers.

## Folder Structure

```
domain/
├── helpers/       # Reusable helper functions used by use cases
├── useCases/      # Business operations organized by feature
└── models/        # Domain entities (if applicable)
```

The domain layer is the heart of the application, containing the core business logic that defines what the application does, independent of how it's presented or stored.
