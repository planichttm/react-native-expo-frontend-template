# Services Layer

Services encapsulate basic data processing, manipulation, and coordinate with repositories to access data. They provide simple transformations and utilities that can be reused across different use cases, acting as a bridge between repositories and the domain layer. Services should contain only simple processing logic and avoid complex business rules or orchestration of multiple service calls.
