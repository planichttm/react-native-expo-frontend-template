# Screens Layer

Screens are responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. They use Hooks to access state and actions, and should contain minimal logic beyond layout and event handling. Screens should be primarily concerned with how things look and behave from a UI perspective, with all business logic and data management delegated to underlying hooks and use cases.
